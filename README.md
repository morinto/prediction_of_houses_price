The housing market in the United Kingdom holds significant importance and interest due to its impact on the economy, individuals, businesses, and the overall financial landscape. Understanding the factors and dynamics affecting house prices is crucial for homeowners, investors, policymakers, and analysts. Various factors, including supply and demand, economic conditions, government policies, and demographic changes, contribute to the fluctuations in house prices across different regions of the country. This research explores the factors, trends, and methodologies associated with house prices in the UK.

Methodology:
The research employs linear regression as a statistical technique for predicting and determining house prices. It involves the identification and quantification of the relationship between independent variables (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location) and the dependent variable (house price). Historical data on house attributes and their corresponding prices are collected and divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to build the linear regression model, while the test set evaluates its predictive accuracy. The model estimates coefficients for each independent variable, allowing the prediction of house prices based on input values. It is important to consider the assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, independence, and normality of residuals.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE MODEL:
The aim of the model is to understand the relationship between various factors and house prices in the UK. The specific objectives include:

Analyzing the impact of crime rate on house prices.
Assessing the influence of residential areas on house prices.
Investigating the relationship between air quality and house prices.
Determining how the number of rooms affects house prices.
Examining the impact of the age of the property on house prices.
Analyzing the influence of specific distances (dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4) on house prices.
Assessing the impact of the number of teachers on house prices.
Investigating the relationship between the proportion of the poor population and house prices.
Determining how the proximity to an airport affects house prices.
Analyzing the relationship between the number of hospital beds and house prices.
Assessing the influence of the number of hotel rooms on house prices.
Investigating the impact of the presence of a waterbody on house prices.
Determining how rainfall affects house prices.
Analyzing the relationship between the existence of a bus terminal and house prices.
Assessing the impact of the availability of parks on house prices.
Data Collection and Refinement:
The research utilizes a dataset obtained from the Kaggle website, consisting of 506 rows and 18 columns. The dataset includes various attributes related to house prices, such as crime rate, residential area, air quality, number of rooms, property age, distances to specific locations, number of teachers, proportion of the poor population, proximity to an airport, number of hospital beds, number of hotel rooms, presence of a waterbody, rainfall, existence of a bus terminal, and availability of parks. The dataset is refined by removing outliers, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant attributes.

Implementation of the Model and Results:
The research implements linear regression with price as the target variable and splits the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the linear regression model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. The model predicts house prices based on the relationship between independent variables and the target variable. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score.

This research aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices in the UK and support informed decision-making for various stakeholders in the housing market.
